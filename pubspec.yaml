  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/img/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Metropolis
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Metropolis-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets/font/Metropolis-Medium.otf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/font/Metropolis-SemiBold.otf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/font/Metropolis-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/font/Metropolis-ExtraBold.otf
          weight: 800
